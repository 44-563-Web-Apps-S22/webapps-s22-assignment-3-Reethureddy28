            <h2>Burger King</h2>
            <p>Burger King (BK) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants.
               Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas,
               and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products.
               Secondly, Burger King creates <b>unique characteristics</b> that differentiate it from its competitors.
               It supplies this differentiation through its advertising and brand representation. Its slogan, <b>Be Your Way</b>,
               lets customers know that the chain offers flexible options.

                  <h3>Dynamic programming</h3>
                  <blockquote>Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
                       Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
                       The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.
                        This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. For example, 
                        if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers we get exponential time complexity and
                       if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.</blockquote>
