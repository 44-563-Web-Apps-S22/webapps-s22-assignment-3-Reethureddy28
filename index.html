            <h2>Burger King</h2>
            <p>Burger King (BK) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants.
               Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas,
               and milkshakes to a larger and more diverse set of products.
               Secondly, Burger King creates <b>unique characteristics</b> that differentiate it from its competitors.
               It supplies this differentiation through its advertising and brand representation. Its slogan, <b>Be Your Way</b>,
               lets customers know that the chain offers flexible options.
